# ethOTG
a simple iOS application that tracks Ethereum metrics &amp; hopefully, eventually wallets

no roadmap, just vibes

I plan on updating the app with light features and functionality as they seem fit. 

WHAT YOU NEED
- Updated Mac with Xcode installed
- Updated iPhone
- Resourcefulness

HOW TO USE
- Create a new project using iOS App settings; name it whatever you'd like; make sure the interface is set to SwiftUI (You may need to create an "organization" to complete this step)
- Download/copy the ContentView.swift file from this repository into your own project
- Go to etherscan.io and create a free account
- Go to your account settings and create a free API Key; copy this key where you see YOUR_ETHERSCAN_API_KEY in the code
- Connect your iPhone to your Mac and choose the device from the navigation bar at the top
- Click the Play button to the left of the navigation bar and the app should attempt to run; you'll have to accept the developer agreement on your iPhone for the very first attempt; navigate to Settings > General > VPN & Device Management and select your app to approve it
- Attempt to run the app again by going back to Xcode and pressing the Play button by the navigation bar and the app should run!
